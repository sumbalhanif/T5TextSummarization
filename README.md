# T5TextSummarization
The project is on text summarization, where I used the T5 model to generate summaries of text. The dataset includes BBC news data with five different topics, each accompanied by summaries that serve as ground truth. UTF encoding has been used, and when asked to perform inference on any AI-related article, the model generates a summary.
